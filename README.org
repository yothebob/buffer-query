#+NAME: In Action

** Get Started
If you download this from github, you can put this folder in your ~/.emacs.d.

#+begin_src bash
  cd ~/.emacs.d
  git clone https://github.com/yothebob/buffer-query.git
#+end_src

NOTE: no capitalizing, that will not work (I know.. need to fix. Check the todo list at the bottom.)

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/buffer-query"))
  (require 'buffer-query)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c b q") 'bq-query)
#+end_src

** Case Scenarios
Working on a project that you want to close all those related buffers. You can pick out a name from the file path that is unique.
#+begin_src elisp
C-c b q "kill where projectname in file"
#+end_src
